T Act Provisions Related to Digital Signature

Section 3 of IT Act, made the provision for it as: Authentication of electronic records.-

(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, any subscriber may authenticate an electronic record by affixing his digital signature.

In IT Act, chapter 3 related to electronic governance, sections 4 and 5 are quite relevant.

Section 4 made the provision for Legal recognition of electronic records — where any law provides that information or any other matter shall be in writing, typewritten or printed form then not-withstanding anything contained in such law, given requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied if such information or matter is—

(a) rendered or made available in an electronic form; and

(b) accessible so as to be usable for a subsequent reference

Section 5 Legal recognition of [electronic signatures] — where law provides that information or any other matter shall be authenticated by affixing the signature or any document should be signed or bear the signature of any person then, notwithstanding anything contained in such law, such requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied, if such information or matter is authenticated by means of [electronic signatures] affixed in such manner as may be prescribed by the Central Government.

Digital Signature Vs. Digital Certificate

Digital signatures are based on three pointers for authentication – Privacy, Non repudiation and Integrity in the virtual world, while the objectives of digital certificate are the authentication of documents, and bind the person who is putting the digital signature, which based on public key cryptography requires two separate keys, as secret and public. However, both the keys are linked together, one key encrypts the plain text, and another decrypts the cipher text, and neither key can perform both the functions. The other difference is digital signature is an electronic process of signing an electronic document while a Digital Certificate is a computer based record which is the identification of certifying agency or the identity of subscriber

Digital Signature Vs. Electronic Signature

The Information Technology Amendment Bill 2006, replaces the word “Digital” with the word “Electronic” at several places in the principal act, which creates a slight difference between the two, electronic signature is wide in nature, while the digital signature is one of the many kinds of electronic signature.

Section 2(ta) “electronic signature” means authentication of any electronic record by a subscriber by means of an electronic technique specified in the second schedule and includes digital signature and section 2(p) defined “Digital Signature Certificate” means a Digital Signature Certificate issued Under sub-section (4) of section 35.

The Indian Evidence Act and Digital Signature

After the IT Act 2000, it was necessary to make an applicable amendment in the Indian Evidence act, to make it compatible.

Section 3 in the definition of “Evidence”, for the words “all documents produced for the inspection of the Court”, the word “all document including electronic records produced for the inspection of the Court”

Section 47A, says when the court has to form an opinion as to the digital signature or any person, the opinion of the certifying authority which has issued the Digital Signature Certificate is a relevant fact. It means while drawing the conclusion, court gives the weight of the digital signature as a relevant fact.

Further 67A proof as to digital signature – except in the case of a secure digital signature, if the digital signature of any subscriber is alleged to have been affixed to an electronic record the fact that such digital signature is the digital signature of the subscriber must be proved.

Section 85B exhibits the positive presumption as  Presumption as to electronic records and digital signatures.- (1) In any proceedings involving a secure electronic record, the Court shall presume unless contrary is proved, that the secure electronic record has not been altered since the specific point of time to which the secure status relates.

Indian Penal Code

Section 464 Making a false document: A person is said to make a false document or false electronic record—

First — who dishonestly or fraudulently-

Makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;

 affixes any [electronic signature] on any electronic record;

makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the  [electronic signature],

with the intention of causing it to be believed that such a document or a part of document, electronic record or  [electronic signature] was made, signed, sealed, executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed; or

Secondly —Who, without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof, after it has been made, executed or affixed with  [electronic signature] either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such alteration; or

Thirdly —Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his  [electronic signature] on any electronic record knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practiced upon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the alteration.]

CHAPTER 2
16[DIGITAL SIGNATURE AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE]
3 S. 3. Authentication of electronic records.—
(1) Subject to the provisions of this section any subscriber may authenticate an electronic record by affixing his digital signature.
(2) The authentication of the electronic record shall be effected by the use of asym- metric crypto system and hash function which envelop and transform the initial electronic
record into another electronic record.
Explanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, “hash function” means an algo- rithm mapping or translation of one sequence of bits into another, generally smaller, set
known as “hash result” such that an electronic record yields the same hash result every
time the algorithm is executed with the same electronic record as its input making it
computationally infeasible —
(a) To derive or reconstruct the original electronic record from the hash result
produced by the algorithm;
(b) that two electronic records can produce the same hash result using the algo- rithm.
(3) Any person by the use of a public key of the subscriber can verify the electronic
record.
(4) The private key and the public key are unique to the subscriber and constitute a
functioning key pair.
7[S. 3A. Electronic signature.—(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section
3, but subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), a subscriber may authenticate any
electronic record by such electronic signature or electronic authentication technique
which—
(a) is considered reliable; and
(b) may be specified in the Second Schedule.
(2) For the purpose of this section any electronic signature or electronic authentication
technique shall be considered reliable if—
(a) the signature creation data or the authentication data are, within the context
in which they are used, linked to the signatory or, as the case may be, the authenticator
and to no other person;
(b) the signature creation data or the authentication data were, at the time of
signing , under the control of the signatory or, as the case may be, the authenticator
and of no other person;
(c) any alteration to the electronic signature made after affixing such signature is
detectable;
(d) any alteration to the information made after its authentication by electronic
signature is detectable; and
(e) it fulfils such other conditions which may be prescribed.
(3) The Central Government may prescribe the procedure for the purpose of ascertaining
whether electronic signature is that of the person by whom it is purported to
have been affixed or authenticated.
(4) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, add to or
omit any electronic signature or electronic authentication technique and the procedure
for affixing such signature from the Second Schedule;
Provided that no electronic signature or authentication technique shall be specified in
the Second Schedule unless such signature or technique is reliable.
(5) Every notification issued under sub-section (4) shall be laid before each House of
Parliament.]

These are the provisions under the IT Act, 2000 in the context of e-governance:

1. Legal Recognition of Electronic Records (Section 4)
Let’s say that a certain law requires a matter written, typewritten, or printed. Even in the case of such a law, the requirement is satisfied if the information is rendered or made available in an electronic form and also accessible for subsequent reference.

2. Legal recognition of digital signatures (Section 5)
Let’s say that the law requires a person’s signature to authenticate some information or a document. Notwithstanding anything contained in such law, if the person authenticates it with a digital signature in a manner that the Central Government prescribes, then he satisfies the requirement of the law.

For the purpose of understanding this, signature means a person affixing his handwritten signature or a similar mark on the document.

3. Use of electronic records and digital signatures in Government and its agencies (Section 6)
(1) If any law provides for –

the filing of a form, application, or any document with any Government-owned or controlled office, agency, body, or authority
the grant or issue of any license, sanction, permit or approval in a particular manner
also, the receipt or payment of money in a certain way
Then, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law in force such filing, grant, issue, payment, or receipt is satisfied even if the person does it in an electronic form. The person needs to ensure that he follows the Government-approved format.

(2) With respect to the sub-section (1), may prescribe:

the format and manner of filing, creating or issuing such electronic records
also, the manner and method of payment of any fees or charges for filing, creating or issuing any such records

(1) Let’s say that the law requires the retention of certain records, documents or information for a specific period. In such cases, the requirement is also satisfied if the retention is in an electronic form, provided:

the information contained therein is accessible and also usable for a subsequent reference.
the format of the electronic record is the same as the one originally created, received or sent. Even if the format is changed, then it must accurately represent the original information.
the electronic record contains details to facilitate the identification of the origin, destination, and also the date and time of the dispatch or receipt of the record.
This is provided that the clause does not apply to any information which is automatically generated primarily for the purpose of enabling an electronic record for dispatch or receipt.

(2) Nothing in this section applies to any law which expressly provides for the retention of records, documents or information electronically.

5. Publication of rules, regulations, etc., in Electronic Gazette (Section 8)
Let’s say that law requires the publishing of official regulation, rule, by-law, notification or any other matter in the Official Gazette. In such cases, the requirement is also satisfied if such rule, regulation, order, bye-law, notification or any other matter is published in the Official Gazette or Electronic Gazette.

However, the date of publication of the rule, regulation, by-law, notification or any other matter is the date of the Gazette first published in any form – Official or Electronic.

6. Section 6,7 and 8 do not confer a right to insist document should be accepted in Electronic form (Section 9)
It is important to note that, nothing contained in Sections 6, 7, and 8 confer a right upon any person to insist either the acceptance, issuance, creation or also retention of any document or a monetary transaction in the electronic form from:

Procedures which facilitate the identification of the person affixing the digital signature
Control processes and procedures to ensure the integrity, security, and confidentiality of electronic payments or records
Further, any other matter which is legally important for digital signatures
Data Protection
Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000:

Let’s say that a body corporate which possesses, deals or handles any sensitive personal data or information in a computer resource which it owns, controls or operates, is certainly negligent in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures leading to a wrongful loss or gain to a person.

In such cases, the body corporate is liable to pay damages by way of compensation. Further, these damages cannot exceed five crore rupees.

Further, the Government of India notified the Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011, under section 43A of the IT Act, 2000. These rules specifically pertain to sensitive personal information or data and are applicable to all body corporates within India.

Electronic Signature – Legal and Technical aspect
The traditional signatures are hand written and are uniquely representative of one’s identity. The use of signature is mandatory in law in certain cases and holds an important legal position in the document as it signify two things, the identity of the person and its intent to it. The Signature is one’s identity on a document and is used in day to day transaction and in case of illiterate persons its fingerprint is considered as his signature. The handwritten signature is prone to forgery and tampering hence insufficient for online transaction and contracts. The online transaction requires unique and strong protection which is served by electronic signature.

The concept of digital signature was introduced through Information Technology Act 2000 in India, which is enhanced with hybrid concept of electronic signature which is based on UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures 2001. The electronic signature is a technologically neutral concept and includes a digital signature. The object and purpose of electronic signature are similar to that of traditional signature. In cyber world electronic signature ensures that the electronic records are authentic and legitimate as electronic signature are safer and cannot be forged and is convenient as the sender himself does not have to be present personally at the place to contract to sign the document. For example a person can sign a contract in India and send it to any part of the world to complete the transaction.

UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures 2001
The purpose of UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures 2001 provides following statement which signifies the importance of electronic signature.

“The increased use of electronic authentication techniques as substitutes for handwritten signatures and other traditional authentication procedures has suggested the need for a specific legal framework to reduce uncertainty as to the legal effect that may result from the use of such modern techniques (which may be referred to generally as “electronic signatures”). The risk that diverging legislative approaches be taken in various countries with respect to electronic signatures calls for uniform legislative provisions to establish the basic rules of what is inherently an international phenomenon, where legal harmony as well as technical interoperability is a desirable objective.”

 


Sec 2 (ta) of Information Technology Act 2000 had defines electronic signature as
“Authentication of any electronic record by a subscriber by means of the electronic technique specified in the second schedule and includes digital signature.”

The definition of electronic signature includes digital signature and other electronic technique which may be specified in the second schedule of the Act, thus an electronic signature means authentication of an electronic record by a subscriber by means of electronic techniques. The adoption of ‘electronic signature’ has made the Act technological neutral as it recognizes both the digital signature method based on cryptography technique and electronic signature using other technologies.

Technical aspect of Digital Signature
The digital signature is created and verified by using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology that requires two keys that is a public key and a private key for encrypting and decrypting the information. The message is encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key and vice versa. The unique feature in public key infrastructure is that the public and private keys are related to each other and only the public key can be used for encrypting messages that can be decrypted using the corresponding private key. The public key is shared, whereas the private key is known only to its possessor. The digital signature is based on Cryptography. Cryptography is the science to secure communications by converting the message (encrypting ) into an unreadable format and only the person with a secret key can decrypt (read) it. Cryptography systems can be broadly classified into two types i.e., symmetric-key and asymmetric.

In symmetric systems, both the sender and recipient have same keys and asymmetric system each user has two keys a public key that is known to everyone and a private key that is known only the recipient of messages. In India signature uses an asymmetric system that has a public key and private key.

Digital Signature Certificates
Digital Signature Certificates are digital format certificate to prove identity in the digital world. The digital signature certificates are issued by Certifying Authorities under the authority of Controller of Certifying Authorities. A Digital Signature Certificate is an electronic document that can be used to verify that the public key belongs to the particular individual. Digital Signature Certificates contains Public key of the certificate owner, Name of the owner, Validity “from” and “to” dates, Name of the issuing authority, Serial number of the certificate, Digital signature of the issuing authority name of the person, etc. There are three different classes of digital certificate. They class I, class II and class III. Depending on the type, each digital certificate provides specific functions.

Legal aspect Digital Signature
Section 3 of the Information Technology Act 2000 provides for authentication of electronic records. It provides that the electronic records can be authenticated by using digital signatures. It lays down technology requirements for digital signatures. It prescribes the use of an asymmetric crypto system and hash function for authentication of electronic records. Authentication of an electronic document is important as it ensures that the message has not been tampered and confirms the creator’s identity, making it non repudiable, i.e., the sender cannot deny its creation. The object of authentication is achieved by the use of asymmetric system and hash function which convent the electronic message into an unreadable format to prevent tampering of electronic record.

A hash function is the method or scheme used for encrypting and decrypts digital signatures. A hash function produces a hash value which is also known as a message digest. It plays an important role in ensuring that the message has not been tampered and information is safe and secure.

Functions of Electronic Signature
The concept of electronic signature was introduced under section 3A of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008. An electronic signature means authentication of an electronic record by a subscriber by any means of electronic authentication techniques. An electronic signature technique can be used as an authorized electronic signature if such technique is notified by the central government in the official gazette or in the second schedule of the Act. There are different types of electronic signature, however, all of them are not secure; hence only the techniques notified in the official gazette or in the second schedule can be used as a legitimate electronic signature. For example typed name, a digitized image of a signature is also a form of electronic signature, but is prone to tampering and are insecure. The electronic signature technique has to be reliable to be recognized as an electronic signature. Section 3A of the Information Technology Act 2000 is based on Article 6 “Compliance with a requirement for a signature” of UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures 2001. The following are the requirement of an electronic signature.

a) It has to be reliable.
b) The central government may notify in the official gazette the technique and procedure for electronic signature or specify in the second schedule of the Information Technology Act 2000.

An electronic Signature shall be considered as reliable if it fulfills following requirement,

 


a) The technique should be such that it can be linked to the creator of the message.
b) The technique of electronic signature must be under the control of the maker of the signature.
c) Any change or alteration to the electronic signature after affixation must be detectable. 
d) Any change or alteration of data after affixing electronic signature must be detectable.

The Central Government is the authority to declare the technique as reliable electronic signature and can add or remove any technique from the electronic authentication technique. As on date the central government has not issued any notification on the concept of electronic signature and thus the electronic signature has not gained much attention. In this regard the Delhi high court has directed the central government to frame policy on electronic signature for authentication of electronic records. The only method of authentication of electronic records in India presently being digital signature as there are no guidelines on use of electronic signature.

The legal recognition of electronic signature has been provided under section 5 of information technology Act 2000. This section equates electronic signature as traditional handwritten signature. It provides that if any, information or document if confirmed by electronic signature shall have the same effect as the affixing of signature if done according to the prescribed manner. The central government shall prescribe the manner in which electronic signature has to be affixed.

Offenses related to Electronic Signature
The offenses related to electronic signature are generally related identity theft, publication of false electronic signature certificate, publication of electronic certificate with fraudulent purpose. Section 66C of the Act punishes for identity theft. This Act punishes fraudulent use of electronic signature of any other person and such person shall be punished with imprisonment of up to three years and will also liable to pay fines which may extend up to one lakh.

Misrepresentation or suppression of material fact in order to obtain any license or electronic signature is an offense under section 71 of the Act. This section is applicable in following cases
a) If a person makes a misrepresentation to the Controller or Certifying authority.
b) If a person suppresses any material fact from, the Controller or Certifying authority.

Such misrepresentation or suppression of material fact with the intent to obtain any license or electronic certificate from, the Controller or Certifying authority is punishable with imprisonment of up to two years and fine up to rupees one lakh. The information to be provided to the Controller or Certifying authority should be proper and correct and presentation of wrong, incorrect or false information is an offense under Section 71 of the Act.

Publication of electronic signature certificate which is false in certain particulars is an offense under section 73 of the Act. The following shall amount to publication of false particulars in an electronic certificate,

a) Publication of Electronic signature certificate which the certifying authority has not issued.
b) Publication of Electronic signature certificate which subscriber of the certificate has not accepted.
c) Publication of Electronic signature certificate which is revoked or suspended.

Sec 74 of the Act punishes creation, publication or providing of electronic signature certificate for fraudulent or unlawful purpose with imprisonment for a term which may extend up to two years or a fine which may extend up to one lakh

INTERMEDIARIES NOT TO BE LIABLE IN
CERTAIN CASES 79 S. 79. Exemption from liability of intermediary in certain cases.—(1) Notwithstanding
anything contained in any law for the time being in force but subject to the
provisions of sub-section (2) and (3), an intermediary shall not be liable for any third
party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by him.
(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply if—
(a) the function of the intermediary is limited to providing access to a commu- nication system over which information made available by third parties is
transmitted or temporarily stored or hosted; or
(b) the intermediary does not—
(i) initiate the transmission,
(ii) select the receiver of the transmission, and
(iii) select or modify the information contained in the transmission;
(c) the intermediary observes due diligence while discharging his duties under
this Act and also observes such other guidelines as the Central Government
may prescribe in this behalf.
(3) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply if—
(a) the intermediary has conspired or abetted or aided or induced, whether by
threats or promise or otherwise in the commission of the unlawful act;
(b) upon receiving actual knowledge, or on being notified by the appropriate
Government or its agency that any information, data or communication link
residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the interme- diary is being used to commit the unlawful act, the intermediary fails to ex- peditiously remove or disable access to that material on that resource without
vitiating the evidence in any manner.
Explanation.—For the purpose of this section, the expression “third party infor- mation” means any information dealt with by an intermediary in his capacity as an intermediary.
LIABILITY OF NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS IN CYBERSPACE
The Indian ITAct,2000 stipulates that Network service providers are not liable in certain cases, for any third party information or data made available by an ISP, if it proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge[1],, or that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commissioning of such offence
[2]. A ‘network service provider’ means any person who provides access to information service in electronic form. For example: Internet service provider, cellular mobile services, customer access services, mobile satellite services etc. It essentially performs two tasks-to provide access to the network and to act as intermediary between an originator and addressee with respect to any particular electronic message.

The position on ISP liability in India is the same as prevailing in other countries. However, with the enforcement of the IT Amendment Bill 2008, certain additional grounds will be added whereby an intermediary shall not be liable for any third party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by him if the function of the intermediary is limited to providing access to a communication system over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hosted; or the intermediary does not initiate the transmission, select the receiver of the transmission, and select or modify the information contained in the transmission and the intermediary observes due diligence while discharging his duties under the Act .The amended Section 79 of the IT Act ( yet to be enforced) provides that intermediaries will be held liable if the intermediary has conspired or abetted or aided or induced, whether by threats or promise or otherwise in the commission of the unlawful act; or upon receiving actual knowledge, or on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any information, data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit the unlawful act, the intermediary fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to that material on that resource without vitiating the evidence in any manner.

U.S Courts have ruled in some decisions that an ISP may be held liable incase of defamation, copyright infringement, child pornography, false advertisement or fraudulent misrepresentation by facilitating distribution of such material[3].However, passage of communications Decency Act 1996, particularly Section 230 (c)(1) has thrown more light on the issue and it aims to restrict the scope of liability of network service providers. In Zeran v America Online Inc[4], court held “Congress enacted Section 230to remove disincentives to selfregulation fearing that the specter of liability would deter service providers from blocking and screening offensive material. Section 230 forbid the imposition of publisher liability on a service provider for the exercise of its editorial and self regulatory functions”. In Doe v America Online , Inc[5] , the plaintiff sued AOL for allowing a subscriber named Russell to use its chatrooms for marketing videotapes and photographs consisting of child pornography in which plaintiff’s minor son appeared. The complaint alleged that AOL was negligent per se in allowing Russell to use its facilities for criminal distribution of obscene materials and it was negligent on common law principles. It was alleged that AOL had received complaints about Russell’s use of its facilities for unlawful purposes but that AOL neither warned Russell nor suspended his service. The Supreme Court of Florida held that Section 230 immunised AOL from liability for negligence based on a subscriber’s use of its facility to distribute child pornography. However, this unqualified immunity is lost if it either provides proprietary content or knowingly distributes the unlawful content. Therefore, Section 230 creates federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a third party user of the service[6]. In U.K strict rules on ISP’s liability exist.
In Godfrey v Demon Internet ltd[7], the defendant ISP carried a newsgroup ‘soc.culture.thai.’ and stored postings for few days. Some one unknown in US made a defamatory posting about a U.K citizen who complained to remove the posting which remained displayed for long .The court held that Demon was informed of publishing a defamatory matter and he neither took reasonable steps to remove content and nor can be said to have no knowledge of the same. Hence, he could not escape liability under UK defamation Act 1996.

The introduction of the internet has brought tremendous changes to our lives. People of all fields are increasingly using the computers to create, transmit and store information in the electronic form instead of the traditional papers, documents. Information stored in electronic forms has many advantages, it is cheaper, easier to store, easier to retrieve and for speedier to connection. Though it has many advantages, it has been misused by many people in order to gain themselves or for the sake or otherwise to harm others. The high and speedier connectivity to the world from any place has developed many crimes and these increased offenses led to the need for a law for protection. Some countries have been rather been vigilant and formed some laws governing the net. In order to keep in pace with the changing generation, the Indian parliament passed the law – Information Technology Act, 2000.[i] The IT Act 2000 has been conceptualized on the United Nations Commissions on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law[ii].

    The Government of India enacted its Information Technology Act, 2000 with the objectives stating officially as: “to provide legal recognition for transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange and other means of electronic communication, commonly referred to as “electronic commerce”, which involve the use of alternatives to paper-based methods of communication and storage of information, to facilitate electronic filing of documents with the Government agencies and further to amend the Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Bankers Books Evidence Act, 1891 and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” [iii]

CYBERCRIME
Cybercrime is a generic term that refers to all criminal activities done using the medium of computers, the Internet, cyberspace and the worldwide web. Computer crime, or Cybercrime, refers to any crime that involves a computer and a network.[iv] The computer may have been used in the commission of a crime, or it may be the target.[v] Netcrime is criminal exploitation of the Internet.[vi]

Dr. Debarati Halder and Dr. K. Jaishankar (2011) define Cybercrimes as: “Offences that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a criminal motive to intentionally harm the reputation of the victim or cause physical or mental harm to the victim directly or indirectly, using modern telecommunication networks such as Internet (Chat rooms, emails, notice boards and groups) and mobile phones (SMS/MMS)”.[vii] Such crimes may threaten a nation’s security and financial health.[viii] Issues surrounding these types of crimes have become high-profile, particularly those surrounding cracking, copyright infringement, child pornography, and child grooming. There are also problems of privacy when confidential information is lost or intercepted, lawfully or otherwise.

An Australian nationwide survey conducted in 2006 found that two in three convicted cyber-criminals were between the ages of 15 and 26.

Internationally, both governmental and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Activity crossing international borders and involving the interests of at least one nation-state is sometimes referred to as cyber warfare. The international legal system is attempting to hold actors accountable for their actions through the International Criminal Court.[ix]

A report (sponsored by McAfee) estimates the annual damage to the global economy at $445 billion.[x]

There isn’t really a fixed definition for cybercrime. The Indian Law has not given any definition to the term ‘cybercrime’. In fact, the Indian Penal Code does not use the term ‘cybercrime’ at any point even after its amendment by the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008, the Indian Cyberlaw. But “Cyber Security” is defined under Section (2) (b) means protecting information, equipment, devices computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction.[xi]

Cyber Crime is not defined officially in the IT Act or in any other legislation. In fact, it cannot be too. Offense or crime has been dealt with elaborately listing various acts and the punishments for each, under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and related legislation. Hence, the concept of cybercrime is just a “combination of crime and computer”.

Cybercrime in a narrow sense (computer crime): Any illegal behavior directed by means of electronic operations that targets the security of computer systems and the data processed by them.[xii]

Cybercrime in a broader sense (computer-related crime):

Any illegal behavior committed by means of, or in relation to, a computer system or network, including such crimes as illegal possession and offering or distributing information by means of a computer system or network.
Any contract for the sale or conveyance of immovable property or any interest in such property;
Any such class of documents or transactions as may be notified by the Central Government Confidential.
CLASSIFICATION OF CYBER OFFENCES
The increased rate of technology in computers has led to the enactment of Information Technology Act 2000. The converting of the paperwork into electronic records, the storage of the electronic data, has tremendously changed the scenario of the country.[xiii]

Offenses: Cyber offenses are the unlawful acts which are carried in a very sophisticated manner in which either the computer is the tool or target or both. Cybercrime usually includes:

(a) Unauthorized access of the computers (b) Data diddling (c) Virus/worms attack (d) Theft of computer system (e) Hacking (f) Denial of attacks (g) Logic bombs (h) Trojan attacks (i) Internet time theft (j) Web jacking (k) Email bombing  (l) Salami attacks (m) Physically damaging computer system.

Since the beginning of civilization, man has always been motivated by the need to make progress and better the existing technologies. This has led to tremendous development and progress which has been a launching pad for further developments. Of all the significant advances made by mankind from the beginning to date, probably the most important of them is the development of the Internet.

However, the rapid evolution of the Internet has also raised numerous legal issues and questions.
