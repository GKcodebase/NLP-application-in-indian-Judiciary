Dear Mr. /Ms. /Mrs. [Name of the Supervisor],

Please accept this letter as a formal complaint regarding the state of the uncleanliness of the neighbourhood which is creating a completely unacceptable living environment and I feel that it is causing a health hazard to the residents and affects public health, property and environment.

During the last 4 days, the maintenance personnel are unable to address the issue of cleaning the sewage and drainage system and has caused most of us discomfort. The polluted water can also lead to the spreading of many communicable diseases.

Thank you in advance for your quick attention to this matter.


Sincerely,
