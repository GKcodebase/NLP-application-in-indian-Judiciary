In the Indian Judicial System, when a new case
comes, it will be helpful for judges, advocates and other people in
the system if they get information about the previous similar cases
handled. Because of the large number of courts and judgments
produced throughout the country, data to be handled is very
large and it is difficult to analyze it manually. So, people have
started thinking about the applications of Machine Learning in
Judiciary, which is a tool that can be used to analyze such a
huge amount of data and help to reduce the complexity of the
issue. Such developments are helping lawyers in Canada and the
legal system there is getting transformed. Adoption of such a
system in India will ease the functioning of the Judiciary. In this
project, the possibility of using Machine Learning capabilities
in Indian judicial system is investigated.It is envisaged to design
an interfacing facility through which a user can get necessary
information after entering the data related to the current case.
The data will be processed in the background using Machine
Learning. Requirement of hardware with high computational
capability will also be investigated to implement this. This system
will also be helpful in the centralization of criminal database and
solving the issue of clogging of cases.
